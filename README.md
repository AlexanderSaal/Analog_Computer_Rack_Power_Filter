# Analog_Computer_Rack_Power_Filter
---

Ripple filter for the power supply of a Analog Computer.

First capacitance multiplier,
then LDO regulator.

How does a capacitance multiplier work:

# Schematic

Schematic if the power supply filter. \
As a first step the power is routed through a capacitance multiplier with a second order RC low pass filter. The corner frequency here is set to around 10 Hz.
